/**
 * @file # Penpot API Client - Example Configuration Template
 *
 * This file serves as a template for the configuration required by the example scripts
 * provided with the Penpot API client. It defines placeholder values for sensitive
 * credentials and IDs that you need to replace with your actual Penpot instance details.
 *
 * @remarks
 * --- SETUP INSTRUCTIONS ---
 * 1. **Copy This File:** Make a copy of this file (`config.ts.sample`) in the same directory (`src/examples/`).
 * 2. **Rename the Copy:** Rename the copied file to `config.ts`.
 * 3. **Fill in Placeholders:** Replace the placeholder values (e.g., `"YOUR_PENPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN"`)
 * with your actual Penpot credentials and IDs.
 *
 * **IMPORTANT NOTE:** The `config.ts` file is explicitly included in the `.gitignore`
 * file of this project. This is a crucial security measure to prevent you from
 * accidentally committing your sensitive credentials to version control (e.g., Git repositories).
 * Always ensure your `config.ts` file remains private and is not shared publicly.

/**
 * Your personal access token from Penpot.
 * This token is required for authenticating your API requests to the Penpot instance.
 *
 * You can generate a personal access token in your Penpot user settings under the "Access Tokens" section.
 * It is highly recommended to generate a new token specifically for API access and manage its permissions carefully.
 *
 * Alternatively, for Deno and Node.js environments, you can set this value as an environment variable
 * named `PENPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN`. The example scripts are configured to read from this environment variable
 * if it exists, falling back to the hardcoded placeholder if not.
 *
 * @constant {string} PENPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN
 * @see https://help.penpot.app/user-guide/personal-access-tokens/ - Official Penpot documentation on Personal Access Tokens.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // In your actual config.ts file:
 * export const PENPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN = "pk_your_actual_access_token_here_1234567890abcdef";
 * ```
 * @example
 * ```bash
 * # Setting as an environment variable (e.g., in your shell profile or CI/CD)
 * export PENPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN="pk_your_actual_access_token_here_1234567890abcdef"
 * ```
 */
export const PENPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN = "YOUR_PENPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN";

/**
 * The base URL of your Penpot instance.
 * This URL is used as the foundation for all API requests made by the client.
 *
 * For the official Penpot cloud version, the base URL is `"https://design.penpot.app"`.
 * If you are self-hosting Penpot, you should use the URL of your own instance (e.g., `"http://localhost:9000"`
 * or your custom domain).
 *
 * Alternatively, you can set this value as an environment variable named `PENPOT_BASE_URL`.
 * The example scripts are configured to read from this environment variable if it exists.
 *
 * @constant {string} PENPOT_BASE_URL
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // In your actual config.ts file:
 * export const PENPOT_BASE_URL = "[https://design.penpot.app](https://design.penpot.app)";
 * ```
 * @example
 * ```bash
 * # Setting as an environment variable
 * export PENPOT_BASE_URL="[https://your-self-hosted-penpot.com](https://your-self-hosted-penpot.com)"
 * ```
 */
export const PENPOT_BASE_URL = "https://design.penpot.app";

/**
 * The ID of the target project where the `demo.penpot` file (or any other file)
 * will be imported by the example scripts.
 *
 * You can find the project ID in the URL of your browser when you are navigating
 * within a project in the Penpot application. It typically appears in the URL path
 * like: `.../project/<project-id>/files`.
 *
 * Alternatively, you can set this value as an environment variable named `TARGET_PROJECT_ID`.
 * The example scripts are configured to read from this environment variable if it exists.
 *
 * @constant {string} TARGET_PROJECT_ID
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // In your actual config.ts file:
 * export const TARGET_PROJECT_ID = "a03ea8b8-fc8a-8124-8006-78afc4291363"; // Example UUID
 * ```
 * @example
 * ```bash
 * # Setting as an environment variable
 * export TARGET_PROJECT_ID="your-project-uuid-here"
 * ```

/**
 * The relative path to the binary `.penpot` file that the example scripts
 * will attempt to import.
 *
 * By default, this path points to a sample `demo.penpot` file included within
 * the `src/examples` directory of this project. You can modify this path
 * to point to any other `.penpot` file on your local file system.
 *
 * @constant {string} DEMO_PENPOT_FILE_PATH
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Default path to the included demo file:
 * export const DEMO_PENPOT_FILE_PATH = "./src/examples/demo.penpot";
 *
 * // Example: Pointing to a different file in the same directory:
 * // export const DEMO_PENPOT_FILE_PATH = "./src/examples/my_custom_design.penpot";
 *
 * // Example: Pointing to a file outside the examples directory (adjust path as needed):
 * // export const DEMO_PENPOT_FILE_PATH = "../../../my_designs/project_alpha.penpot";
 * ```
